# Writing Docker files, Part II

Recalling from the Docker birthday App, we wrote a Docker file to build a Docker image and run.
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile, a text file that contains all the commands, in order, needed to build a given image. Dockerfiles adhere to a specific format and use a specific set of instructions.


## Write a Dockerfile
We want to create a Docker image with this web app. As mentioned above, all user images are based on a _base image_. Since our application is written in Python, we will build our own Python image based on [Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/). We'll do that using a **Dockerfile**.

A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) is a text file that contains a list of commands that the Docker daemon calls while creating an image. The Dockerfile contains all the information that Docker needs to know to run the app &#8212; a base Docker image to run from, location of your project code, any dependancies it has, and what commands to run at start-up. It is simple way to automate the image creation process. The best part is that the [commands](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) you write in a Dockerfile are *almost* identical to their equivalent Linux commands. This means you don't really have to learn new syntax to create your own Dockerfiles.


1. Create a file called **Dockerfile**, and add content to it as described below.

  We'll start by specifying our base image, using the `FROM` keyword:

  ```
  FROM alpine:latest
  ```

2. The next step usually is to write the commands of copying the files and installing the dependencies. But first we will install the Python pip package to the alpine linux distribution. This will not just install the pip package but any other dependencies too, which includes the python interpreter. Add the following [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run) command next:
  ```
  RUN apk add --update py-pip
  ```

3. Let's add the files that make up the Flask Application.

  Install all Python requirements for our app to run. This will be accomplished by adding the lines:

  ```
  COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /usr/src/app/requirements.txt
  ```

  Copy the files you have created earlier our image by using [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy)  command.

  ```
  COPY app.py /usr/src/app/
  COPY templates/index.html /usr/src/app/templates/
  ```

4. Specify the port number which needs to be exposed. Since our flask app is running on `5000` that's what we'll expose.
  ```
  EXPOSE 5000
  ```

5. The last step is the command for running the application which is simply - `python ./app.py`. Use the [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) command to do that:

  ```
  CMD ["python", "/usr/src/app/app.py"]
  ```

  The primary purpose of `CMD` is to tell the container which command it should run by default when it is started.

6. Verify your Dockerfile.

  Our `Dockerfile` is now ready. This is how it looks:

  ```
  # our base image
  FROM alpine:latest

  # Install python and pip
  RUN apk add --update py-pip

  # install Python modules needed by the Python app
  COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /usr/src/app/requirements.txt

  # copy files required for the app to run
  COPY app.py /usr/src/app/
  COPY templates/index.html /usr/src/app/templates/

  # tell the port number the container should expose
  EXPOSE 5000

  # run the application
  CMD ["python", "/usr/src/app/app.py"]
  ```

## Build the image

Now that you have your `Dockerfile`, you can build your image. The `docker build` command does the heavy-lifting of creating a docker image from a `Dockerfile`.

When you run the `docker build` command given below, make sure to replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>` with your username. This username should be the same one you created when registered on [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com). If you haven't done that yet, please go ahead and create an account.

The `docker build` command is quite simple - it takes an optional tag name with `-t` flag and a location of the directory containing the `Dockerfile` - the `.` indicates the current directory:

```
$ docker build -t <YOUR_USERNAME>/myfirstapp .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 9.728 kB
Step 1 : FROM alpine:latest
 ---> 0d81fc72e790
Step 2 : RUN apk add --update py-pip
 ---> Running in 8abd4091b5f5
fetch http://dl-4.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.3/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz
fetch http://dl-4.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.3/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz
...
...
 ---> Running in 78e324d26576
 ---> 2f7357a0805d
Removing intermediate container 78e324d26576
Successfully built 2f7357a0805d
```

If you don't have the `alpine:latest` image, the client will first pull the image and then create your image. Therefore, your output on running the command will look different from mine. If everything went well, your image should be ready! Run `docker images` and see if your image (`<YOUR_USERNAME>/myfirstapp`) shows.

## Run your image
The last step in this section is to run the image and see if it actually works.

```
$ docker run -p 8888:5000 --name myfirstapp YOUR_USERNAME/myfirstapp
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Head over to `http://localhost:8888` and your app should be live. **Note** If you are using Docker Machine, you may need to open up another terminal and determine the container ip address using `docker-machine ip default`.

OK, now that you are done with this container, stop and remove it since you won't be using it again.

Open another terminal window and execute the following commands:

```
$ docker stop myfirstapp
$ docker rm myfirstapp
```

or

```
$ docker rm -f myfirstapp
```

## Dockerfile commands summary

Here's a quick summary of the few basic commands we used in our Dockerfile.

* `FROM` starts the Dockerfile. It is a requiremnet that the Dockerfile must start with the `FROM` command. Images are created in layers, which means you can use another image as the base image for your own. The `FROM` command defines  your base layer. As arguments, it takes the name of the image. Optionally, you can add the Docker Hub username of the maintainer and image version, in the format `username/imagename:version`.

* `RUN` is used to build up the Image you're creating. For each `RUN` command, Docker will run the command then create a new layer of the image. This way you can roll back your image to previous states easily. The syntax for a `RUN` instruction is to place the full text of the shell command after the `RUN` (e.g., `RUN mkdir /user/local/foo`). This will automatically run in a `/bin/sh` shell. You can define a different shell like this: `RUN /bin/bash -c 'mkdir /user/local/foo'`

* `COPY` copies local files into the container.

* `CMD` defines the commands that will run on the Image at start-up. Unlike a `RUN`, this does not create a new layer for the Image, but simply runs the command. There can only be one `CMD` per a Dockerfile/Image. If you need to run multiple commands, the best way to do that is to have the `CMD` run a script. `CMD` requires that you tell it where to run the command, unlike `RUN`. So example `CMD` commands would be:
```
  CMD ["python", "./app.py"]

  CMD ["/bin/bash", "echo", "Hello World"]
```

* `EXPOSE` opens ports in your image to allow communication to the outside world when it runs in a container.

# Creating Containers, Part II

## Running An Official Image

```shell
$ docker run elasticsearch:2
```

​Moving on from our quick jaunt around the Docker Hub's official image, it's time to try and run one. The command above will run elasticsearch inside a container. You'll quickly notice that there's a fair bit of output :smile: This is pretty normal, we'll often want to see the logging for the containers we run. We're also "attached" to this container, meaning our shell is currently inoperable. This is our first long-running process in a container. Let's `Control-c` out of this and try something else.

```shell
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                       PORTS               NAMES
1f4d1a69ae13        elasticsearch:2     "/docker-entrypoint.s"   2 minutes ago       Exited (130) 6 seconds ago                       sad_bassi

```

Breaking away from our container with `Control-c` has stopped our container, but not removed it. This is expected, as we didn't use `--rm` when running the container. We can delete this container by passing it's `ID` or `NAMES` to `docker rm`

```shell
$ docker rm <ID|NAME>
```

## Attempt #2

```shell
$ docker run -d --name elasticsearch elasticsearch:2
4d9caea44ba72b69b0728462b9f9f776d9823eec54da64249a1039a4a40bde6b

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
4d9caea44ba7        elasticsearch:2     "/docker-entrypoint.s"   22 seconds ago      Up 21 seconds       9200/tcp, 9300/tcp   elasticsearch
```

This  time, we are not attached to the container, but we can see that it is running and it's adopted the name we provided, `elasticsearch`. Providing names to containers makes it a little easier to issue further commands, just keep in mind that a container name **MUST** be unique and attempting to run another container with a used name will result in an error:

```shell
$ docker run --name elasticsearch elasticsearch:2
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The name "/elasticsearch" is already in use by container 4d9caea44ba72b69b0728462b9f9f776d9823eec54da64249a1039a4a40bde6b. You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name..

```

### Getting a Containers Logs

```shell
$ docker logs elasticsearch

# Or follow, much like tail -f, with ...
$ docker logs -f elasticsearch
```

### Container Ports

In our `docker ps` output above, we can see that it mentions "PORTS" and, specifically, mentions ports `9200/tcp` and `9300/tcp`. That's because the Elasticsearch image is letting us know that these ports provide something to us. Unfortunately, if you try and access this port, it is going to fail.

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:9200
```

That's because we didn't expose the ports to our host.

## Attempt #3

```shell
$ docker run -d -P --name elasticsearch elasticsearch:2
eaf047ef4b24313d0f9846dfcebf10139ad1ecaef8433310c511307b5fba5c67

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                              NAMES
eaf047ef4b24        elasticsearch:2     "/docker-entrypoint.s"   3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:32769->9200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32768->9300/tcp   elasticsearch
```

Lets take a look at those `PORT` definintions now:

```shell
0.0.0.0:32769->9200/tcp
```

By running our container with the `-P` flag, we have asked Docker to publish all of the images ports to our host on random ports. Those random ports came out as `32769` and `32768`.

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:9200
{
  "name" : "Nyah Check",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "2.4.0",
    "build_hash" : "ce9f0c7394dee074091dd1bc4e9469251181fc55",
    "build_timestamp" : "2016-08-26T09:14:17Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "5.5.2"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}

```

​:boom: We have Elasticsearch :smile:

### Explicit Ports

Don't want to use random ports? Instead of `-P` for publishing-all, you can manually expose the ports, and restrict the listening address, with:

```shell
$ docker run -p 0.0.0.0:9200:9200 elasticsearch:2
```
